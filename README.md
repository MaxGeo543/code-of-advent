# advent of code
This repository contains my solutions for [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2023 (and in future other years) implemented in python. I first started participating in advent of code in 2023. Any earlier years (if present) will not have been provided in the given year. 

My personal puzzle input will be in its own text file for each day as well as any test inputs given in the puzzle description. I use asserts on these test inputs to test my implementations. 
The puzzle description will be at the beginning of each python file as a comment. 

Each python file has a part1() and part2() function that each print AND return the result. In the main section, all asserts take place and then part1() and part2() are called.
